# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs may be viewed in the ADO wiki or previewed locally (see instructions below). Note, ADRs do not need to be created with this tool, although it is encouraged as it streamlines the creation and consumption of ADRs.

## Development

To preview the knowledge base locally, run:

```bash
yarn run adr/preview
```

In preview mode, the Hot Reload feature is enabled: any change you make to a markdown file is applied live in the UI.

To create a new ADR interactively, run:

```bash
yarn run adr/new
```
